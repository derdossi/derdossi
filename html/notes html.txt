1. Always put <Doctype html> on the first line of the document. It tells the browser the type of the document.
2. <html> indicates the start of the document and </html> indicates the end of the document.
3. <head> element contains additional information about the page. It does not appear in the main area of the page.
    - within the <head> element : indication of character set (i.e <meta charset = "UTF-8" />). If not specified some special characters might not be displayed.
    - <meta> element has no closing tag: Exception like <br>, <img> etc..
    - <title> element is displayed at the top of the browser window.
4.  Everything inside the <body> element is displayed in the main area of the browser.
    - a <h1> defines the main heading. Sub headings: <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>, <h7>.
    - text between <p> and </p> is a paragraph.
5. After each opening tag, the next element should be indented(with a tab or two spaces) for better overview.
6. To insert and image we use <img>. It has one opening tag but no closing tag. It contains a src and an alt attribute.
    - The src attribute specifies the URL, that is the location and name of the image. 
    - The alt attribute is an "alternative text", which describes the content of them image. (Useful for search engines and if for no reason the image cannot be
    displayed)

Relative and absolute URLs

- URLs used for src attribute in images and also for the href attribute of lings. The URL specifies the "address" of the file. Depending on the location of the file
a relative or absolute URL must be used.
- If a file is part of a website, then a Relative URL can be used.
- Either relative to the current html page or relative to the root of the website.
- Same folder : File name can be used (I.e dossi.png).

Basics

- HTML describes the structure of the website and css defines the visual appearance.
- It is not mandatory to differentiate between structure and style. But it usually better to write css and html in different files.
- CSS files end with the extension .css
- Linking a css file to a HTML file is done by <link> element.

Color styles

- The combination of color is represented by a mixture of different portions of Red, Green and Blue (RGB).
- These can be expressed in different ways (example indicates the color grey):
        Hex values : #607d8b
        RGB values : rgb(96, 125, 139)

CSS Selectors 
- Type Selectors : targets all elements with a specific html tag. (I.e p { ...} to target all paragraphs [<p>...</p>])

- Class Selectors
    - used very frequently. They select specific "classes" (groups of elements) rather than all elements of one type.
    - To use a class selector add a class attribute to an element(of any value) (i.e <p class="dossi">...</p>)
    - In CSS you can now address all elements that have the same class attribute.
    - In CSS classes are denoted by a leading point and the class value(i.e .dossi {...}).
    - Items can have multiple classes separated by a space (<p class="dossi boggo">...</p>) 
- ID Selectors
    - are very similar to Class selectors. They select all HTML elements with an attribute id with a specific value. (i.e <p id="navigation"> ...</p>)
    - Ids are denoted by a leading hash sign (#) followed by the id value. (i.e #navigation { ...})
    - IMPORTANT: The ID selector should only be used once in a HTML page, while a class may be used for any number of elements.
